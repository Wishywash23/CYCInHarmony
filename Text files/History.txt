Our Journey

Beginnings:	 Our musical adventure began in 1997 when Sue Hallam, then with the Stoke-on-Trent City Music School, had a vision to create the City Youth Choir. This choir became a haven for children aged 11-18 to explore their love for music and connect with like-minded friends. Beyond singing, it opened doors to exciting travel and performances worldwide.

Reunion and Renewal:	 Fast forward to 2023, Sue, now retired after a stellar career leading the City Music School, proposed a reunion concert for her 70th birthday in 2024. Expecting a handful of members to join, she was thrilled when over 30 former members reunited, forming 'The Reunion Choir' with some traveling from as far as Dubai.

A Night to Remember:	 In November 2024, Stoke Minster Church echoed with an emotional, uplifting celebration of our musical past. The audience was moved, and the performance was a resounding success. Most members didn’t want the journey to end there.

A New Chapter:	 By the end of November 2024, a new committee formed, and within three weeks, we had a plan to make the choir a permanent fixture for music lovers.

Our Present:	 Term 1 of Year 1 kicked off in January 2025 with over 20 members, hearts brimming with music. And this is just the beginning…
