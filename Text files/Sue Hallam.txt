Sue Hallam, already a well-known and established figure within the North Staffordshire music scene, has taken on a new and exciting challenge. After retiring as Head of the Stoke-On-Trent Music Service, where she spent over 33 years working in both high schools and primary schools across the county, Sue takes great pride in her contributions to the development of choral singing for young people aged 4-18 in the city. She has now formed a new choir comprising mainly of her former students (now adults), whom she is passionately helping to reconnect with music. Her long-standing involvement with the Penkhull Music Festival has further enhanced her reputation, reaching well beyond the local community.
