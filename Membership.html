            <h2>First Steps...</h2>
            <p>Experience isn't important to us, but a basic level of ability is. <br>So before joining, we invite anyone interested to come along to a rehearsal (or 2) free of charge.<br>This is an opportunity for you to see if we are the right fit for you and vice versa.<br>The social aspect of the group is just as important to us as the performance, so it's important that both parties are happy :)<br><br> If you are interested, you can start by sending us a message through the CONTACT page above - we'll then be in touch to let you know when the next rehearsal you can attend will be.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>What then?</h2>
            <p>After attending a rehearsal (or 2), a committee member will have a quick chat with you.<br><br>If the Musical Director (MD) is happy that they could hear you with the group and both parties are happy, you'll be invited to be a member.<br><br>If we were unable to hear you in the group - you may be invited to a very brief, informal one to one audition with the MD. <br> Don't worry, we're not looking for perfection, just that you can hold a tune and follow direction.<br><br>   </p>
			<p>If you are invited to be a member, you will be asked to complete the registration form on this link<p>
